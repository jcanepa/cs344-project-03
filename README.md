# mush shell

I wrote a shell from scratch, which can be used to run commands in a child process. This project was written in C.  

## Usage
Run `./mush` from the root of the cloned repo. This brings you into the mush shell.

## Commands

- `ls`
- `cd`
- `exit`
- `which sh`
- `echo $PATH`
- & more!

## Terminate  
Close the shell by typing `exit` or by keying command + C.
